# Gold-price-forecast
It was the journal which made by an Indian Professor Bunhi Guha.
I put the initail journal which consists of his redult and my replication. I named them as my result. After geting Dicky Fuller test I found that the price of gold is not staionary. Therefore, I get first diff and get the test again as I guess it was stationary. Then I figured ACF and PACF to find the initial guess about Auto regression moving average (ARIMA). FInally I By AIC and BIC and figuring differrent typs of Arima, I find out the best one and figured all of them simultaneously.
